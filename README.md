Scrapes listings from career websites (one in particular right now) and maintains a state of what are new listings, existing listings, and listings that were closed. I started it as a distraction to get over some bad news so don't judge me too much for its existence. WIP but was going to eventually have it run on a Lambda writing the result to S3 to surface the data and send an email when new listings arrive.
